{"name":"Clui","body":"### Why does this exist?\r\nSimply to facilitate building terminal applications in PHP. From the lack of relevant documentation/tutorials available online it seems this situation isn't very popular, but maybe that was because ncurses is not the most friendly of beasts. Enter Clui, an object-oriented PHP wrapper for ncurses. It helps you focus on building your application instead of fighting with the terminal.\r\n\r\n### What's included?\r\nOne base class, `Clui_View` which supports positioning, window heirarchy, padding, borders and text rendering.\r\nUpon this base class I've also built the included `Clui_List`. This class lets you build a list of items, optionally divided into columns, optionally user-selectable. Run `test.php` for an example. As an extension, `Clui_Table` supports tabular data, with built-in scrolling and selectability. An example is available in `test_table.php`.\r\n\r\n### Can I use it for _____?\r\nYes. I'd appreciate a link back to the github repository, but that's up to you.","tagline":"Command line UI library for PHP 5.3+","google":"UA-30765514-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
